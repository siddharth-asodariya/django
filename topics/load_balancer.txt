Never drive the https traffic from Django. Use Nginx or Load balancer to do it.
To serve the ssl traffic from Django we should put nginx ahead of it or use cloud load balancer.
Django servers are not well optimized to decrypt and encrypt the ssl certificates. nginx and cloud load balaners has built in support 
for it and they are well optimized to support it.
